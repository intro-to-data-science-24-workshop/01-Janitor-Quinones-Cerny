# Working with dplyr


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the janitor package in R. Specifically, this session will examine the packages usefuleness for data cleaning, data exploration, and working with 'tabyls'. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the janitor package and data cleaning workflow, (2) show you key functions of the pacakge for cleaning and exploration, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.


## Tutorial

The session is accompanied by a tutorial, which can be accessed [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/intro-to-data-science-24/labs/02e4175f0b23aef7e2c79ca67cf1e7da29520e2b/session-03-tidyverse-functions/3-tidyverse-functions.html).
